Welcome to my blog! I plan to make this the home for my notes on research and development, especially on the topics of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. You'll find a few different categories of articles here:

* **Lectures**: introductions to machine/deep learning topics, including implementation details, which should be useful to others trying to learn about these topics.
* **Reviews**: my thoughts and understanding of recent research articles.
* **Tutorials**: step-by-step programming guides outlining how to get things done.
* **Commentary**: random rambling about the world as I see it at the moment.

Honestly, this blog is more about me than it is about youâ€”this is how I force myself to review material, try to develop a deeper understanding, motivate myself to code, and keep notes on "how the hell did I do that?" for later. But I hope that you'll find something useful here, and I hope that you'll join [Disqus](https://www.disqus.com) to chime in on the message boards with questions and thoughts. I'll be listening.
